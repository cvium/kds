# KDS
Implementation of various data structures and algorithms described in my Master's thesis

## What works
Almost nothing of real value works. The following is a list of stuff that almost works.

- Kinetic Sorted List
- Kinetic and dynamic tournament tree (mostly works)
- Convex DT (works for 0-tri and circles if points are in general position)
- DCEL (faces not working, but also not required)
- NaiveEMST (uses Convex DT, so it has the same limitations)
- Weight Balanced Tree
